    "# A Gentle Introduction to PyTorch\n",

    "In our previous PyTorch [notebook](https://medium.com/dair-ai/pytorch-1-2-quickstart-with-google-colab-6690a30c38d), we learned about how to get started quickly with PyTorch using Google Colab. In this tutorial, we are going to take a step back and review some of the basic components of building a deep learning model using PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a brief tutorial and will avoid using jargon and overcomplicated code. That said, this is perhaps the most basic of models you can build with PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "If fact, it is so basic that it's ideal for those starting to learn about PyTorch and deep learning. So if you have a friend or colleague that wants to jump in, I highly encourage you to refer them to this tutorial as a starting point. Let's get started!\n",

    "We need to import a few modules which will be useful to obtain the necessary functions that will help us to build our deep learning model. The main ones are `torch` and `torchvision`. They contain the majority of the functions that you need to get started with PyTorch. However, as this is a deep learning tutorial we will need `torch.nn`, `torch.nn.functional` and `torchvision.transforms` which all contain utility functions to build our model. We probably won't use all the modules listed below but they are the typical modules you will be importing when starting your deep learning projects.  "

    "Here are the complete steps we are performing when importing our data:\n",
    "- We will import and tranform the data into tensors using the `transforms` module\n",
    "- We will use `DataLoader` to build convenient data loaders, which makes it easy to efficiently feed data in batches to deep learning models. We will get to the topic of batches in a bit but for now just think of them as subsets of your data. \n",
    "- As hinted above, we will also create batches of the data by setting the `batch` parameter inside the data loader. Notice we use batches of `32` in this tutorial but you can change it to `64` if you like. "

    "## The Model\n",
    "Now it's time to build the deep learning model that will be used to perform the image classification. We will keeps things simple and stack a few dense layers and a dropout layer to train our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss a bit about the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First of all the following structure involving a `class` is standard code that's used to build the neural network model in PyTorch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # layers go here\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        # computations go here\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The layers are defined inside `def __init__()`. `super(...).__init__()` is just there to stick things together. For our model, we stack a hidden layer (`self.d1`) followed by a dropout layer (`self.dropout`), which is then followed by an output layer (`self.d2`). \n",
    "- `nn.Linear(...)` defines the dense layer and it requires the `in` and `out` dimensions, which corresponds to the size of the input feature and output feature of that layer, respectively. \n",
    "- `nn.Dropout(...)` is used to define a dropout layer. Dropout is an approach in deep learning that helps a model to avoid overfitting. This means that dropout acts as a regularization technique that helps the model to not overfit on the images it has seen while training. We want this because we need a model that generalizes well to unseen examples -- in our case, the testing dataset. Dropout randomly zeroes some of the units of the neural network layer with probability of `p=0.2`. Read more about the dropout layer [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#dropout). \n",
    "- The entry point of the model, i.e. where the data enters, is placed under the `forward(...)` function. Typically, we also place other transformations we perform on the data while training inside this function. \n",
    "- In the `forward()` function we are performing a series of computations on the input data\n",
    "    - we flatten the images first, converting it from 2D (`28 X 28`) to 1D (`1 X 784`).\n",
    "    - then we feed the batches of those 1D images into the first hidden layer\n",
    "    - the output of that hidden layer is then applied a [non-linear activate function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) called `ReLU`. It's not so important to know what `F.relu()` does at the moment, but the effect that it achieves is that it allows faster and more effective training of neural architectures on large datasets\n",
    "    - as explained above, the dropout also helps the model to train more efficiently by avoiding overfitting on the training data\n",
    "    - we then feed the output of that dropout layer into the output layer (`d2`)\n",
    "    - the result of that is then fed to the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function), which converts or normalized the output into a probability distribution which helps with outputting proper predictions values that are used to calculate the accuracy of the model; this will the final output of the model"

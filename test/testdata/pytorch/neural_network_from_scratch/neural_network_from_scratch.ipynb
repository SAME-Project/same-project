    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will implement a simple neural network from scratch using PyTorch. The idea of the tutorial is to teach you the basics of PyTorch and how it can be used to implement a neural network from scratch. I will go over some of the basic functionalities and concepts available in PyTorch that will allow you to build your own neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of how a neural network works. Donâ€™t worry! Even if you are not so sure, you will be okay. For advanced PyTorch users, this tutorial may still serve as a refresher. This tutorial is heavily inspired by this [Neural Network implementation](https://repl.it/talk/announcements/Build-a-Neural-Network-in-Python/5457) coded purely using Numpy. In fact, I tried re-implementing the code using PyTorch instead and added my own intuitions and explanations. Thanks to [Samay](https://repl.it/@shamdasani) for his phenomenal work, I hope this inspires many others as it did with me."

    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we are not going to be talking math stuff, that's for another day. I just want you to get a gist of what it takes to build a neural network from scratch using PyTorch. Let's break down the model which was declared via the class above. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Header\n",
    "First, we defined our model via a class because that is the recommended way to build the computation graph. The class header contains the name of the class `Neural Network` and the parameter `nn.Module` which basically indicates that we are defining our own neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Neural_Network(nn.Module):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initialization\n",
    "The next step is to define the initializations ( `def __init__(self,)`) that will be performed upon creating an instance of the customized neural network. You can declare the parameters of your model here, but typically, you would declare the structure of your network in this section -- the size of the hidden layers and so forth. Since we are building the neural network from scratch, we explicitly declared the size of the weights matrices: one that stores the parameters from the input to hidden layer; and one that stores the parameter from the hidden to output layer. Both weight matrices are initialized with values randomly chosen from a normal distribution via `torch.randn(...)`. Note that we are not using bias just to keep things as simple as possible.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, ):\n",
    "    super(Neural_Network, self).__init__()\n",
    "    # parameters\n",
    "    # library/python:3.10-slim-buster: parameters can be parameterized instead of declaring them here\n",
    "    self.inputSize = 2\n",

    "    self.W2 = torch.randn(self.hiddenSize, self.outputSize) # 3 X 1 tensor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Forward Function\n",
    "The `forward` function is where all the magic happens (see below). This is where the data enters and is fed into the computation graph (i.e., the neural network structure we have built). Since we are building a simple neural network with one hidden layer, our forward function looks very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def forward(self, X):\n",
    "    self.z = torch.matmul(X, self.W1) \n",
    "    self.z2 = self.sigmoid(self.z) # activation function\n",
    "    self.z3 = torch.matmul(self.z2, self.W2)\n",
    "    o = self.sigmoid(self.z3) # final activation function\n",
    "    return o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` function above takes the input `X`and then performs a matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul(...)`) with the first weight matrix `self.W1`. Then the result is applied an activation function, `sigmoid`. The resulting matrix of the activation is then multiplied with the second weight matrix `self.W2`. Then another activation if performed, which renders the output of the neural network or computation graph. The process I described above is simply what's known as a `feedforward pass`. In order for the weights to optimize when training, we need a backpropagation algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Backward Function\n",
    "The `backward` function contains the backpropagation algorithm, where the goal is to essentially minimize the loss with respect to our weights. In other words, the weights need to be updated in such  a way that the loss decreases while the neural network is training (well, that is what we hope for). All this magic is possible with the gradient descent algorithm which is declared in the `backward` function. Take a minute or two to inspect what is happening in the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def backward(self, X, y, o):\n",
    "    self.o_error = y - o # error in output\n",
    "    self.o_delta = self.o_error * self.sigmoidPrime(o) \n",
    "    self.z2_error = torch.matmul(self.o_delta, torch.t(self.W2))\n",
    "    self.z2_delta = self.z2_error * self.sigmoidPrime(self.z2)\n",
    "    self.W1 += torch.matmul(torch.t(X), self.z2_delta)\n",
    "    self.W2 += torch.matmul(torch.t(self.z2), self.o_delta)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we are performing a lot of matrix multiplications along with the transpose operations via the `torch.matmul(...)` and `torch.t(...)` operations, respectively. The rest is simply gradient descent -- there is nothing to it."
